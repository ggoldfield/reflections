What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It tells git that you will using version control, but doesnt actually start tracking anything.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows commits to be grouped before commiting. its a place to show where things have changed before you actually push them remote.
